## Research Overview

During my doctoral studies, I primarily focused on learnable regularization algorithms and theories for deep representation of high-dimensional data, with applications in reconnaissance data recovery and microscopic material structure analysis. I have formally published 9 academic papers in total, including 5 first-author papers, with 4 additional papers currently under review. I hold 1 Chinese invention patent.
