## Research Interests 🔍

Currently, my research centers on **memory and reasoning mechanisms in implicit neural representations (INRs)** 🧠. I am particularly interested in understanding how these continuous neural functions can encode, store, and manipulate information in ways that enable complex reasoning capabilities 💡.

Looking forward, I plan to further explore **memory and reasoning mechanisms in generative models** 🤖, aiming to uncover the principles that govern how these models can maintain long-term memory while generating coherent and contextually appropriate outputs. This research direction holds significant promise for advancing our understanding of artificial intelligence systems that can learn, remember, and reason effectively 🚀.
